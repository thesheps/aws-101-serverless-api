# Recipe 3 - The AWS CDK

This workshop introduces a new set of tools that you can use to create AWS Resources - the AWS CDK. And what does CDK stand for? *C*loud **D**evelopment **K**it. It's an [Object Oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) multi-language library created by the folks over at AWS which wraps common components in [Classes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)>) which you can then use to build up larger Constructs and Applications (more on these terms next!)
