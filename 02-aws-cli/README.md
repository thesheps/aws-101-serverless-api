# Recipe 2 - The AWS CLI

This workshop builds on [Recipe #1](../01-aws-console/README.md). Every\* surface area, component and configuration option that AWS supports is also backed by an API endpoint. This is how companies like [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com) are able to provide common tooling such as `Terraform` which are able to create AWS resources.

Amazon themselves distribute a free `Python` **C**ommand **L**ine **I**nterpreter which provides you with all the tools to create, modify and destroy AWS resources from your laptop! This Recipe builds our `helloWorld` API using this CLI.
