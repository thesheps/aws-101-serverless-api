# Recipe 4 - Terraform

This workshop introduces a new paradigm for configuring resources in AWS - [Declarative Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming). Instead of _procedurally_ creating resources in an explicit step-by-step way, here we define our **end state**, and the framework works out how to make it happen using graph theory to figure out the order in which things need to happen!
